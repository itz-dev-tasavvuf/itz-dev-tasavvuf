## 🚧 Current Projects
- **RedTeamAI MVP** (WIP): Automated adversarial testing framework for LLMs  
- **PromptArmor**: Detection system for malicious prompt patterns  
- **VulnDB**: Community-driven AI vulnerability database  

## 🧠 Development Philosophy
> *"You can't defend what you can't break"*  
> I specialize in:
> - Offensive testing of neural networks
> - Adversarial pattern recognition
> - AI safety through controlled chaos
> - Making security accessible through automation

## 🌱 Growing In Public
**2024 Goals**  
| Quarter | Focus Area |
|---------|------------|
| Q3      | Core attack vectors MVP |
| Q4      | Community threat library |

**Learning Now**  
- [ ] Advanced model inversion techniques  
- [ ] Compliance frameworks (NIST AI RMF)  
- [ ] GPU-accelerated attack simulations  

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate
I'm actively looking for:
- Beta testers for early tools
- Research partners in AI safety
- War stories from production systems
- Coffee chats about adversarial ML
